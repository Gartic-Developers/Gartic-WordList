Code of Conduct
This project strictly rejects any form of discrimination based on race, ethnicity, culture, or religion. Contributors are expected to add only respectful, constructive, and non-harmful content to the project.

Contributors should not include any inappropriate words for any race, insults, use of personal names, nicknames, or controversial, discriminatory expressions. Such content not only damages the project but also threatens the security and friendly environment of the community.

If any offensive words, insults, bullying, hate speech, racism, or harmful content is found in a contribution, that content will be immediately removed, and the contributor will be contacted. Project maintainers will take all necessary actions to prevent such content and ensure that the project remains a secure and respectful environment.

While this project is open to everyone, the inclusion of malicious, harmful, or bullying content will not be tolerated. Contributing means enhancing the project, but it does not mean adding harmful, toxic, or racist content to it. Our goal is to ensure that everyone has a safe and respectful experience.

By contributing to this project, you agree to adhere to the above Code of Conduct.
